### **Gallery App - Showcasing the Power of React**

This gallery app is a modern, responsive web application built entirely with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, demonstrating the versatility and power of these technologies. With clean navigation enabled by **React Router DOM**, the app offers users a smooth and intuitive experience for browsing, saving, and managing their favorite photos.

#### **Key Features:**

- **Home & Favorites Pages**: The app consists of a homepage where users can search for photos and a favorites page to store selected photos. Favorites are saved in **local storage**, making this app lightweight without needing a backend.
  
- **Photo Search with Unsplash API**: Users can search for photos online through the **Unsplash API**. The search results are displayed in a dynamic grid layout. Each search query is limited to 30 images per page, but if more images are available, a "Load More" button appears, allowing users to load additional results seamlessly.

- **Infinite Scroll & Lazy Loading**: The gallery supports smooth scrolling through search results. As users scroll through the images, additional images load without disrupting the experience. The app intelligently handles loading states with **modern animations** to keep the user informed.

- **Add to Favorites**: Users can add photos they like to the favorites page, and can just as easily remove them. This functionality is stored locally, ensuring user preferences are remembered across sessions.

- **Dark Mode & Light Mode Toggle**: The app features a theme toggle, letting users switch between dark and light modes with beautifully styled transitions that enhance the user experience.

- **Modern Animations & Transitions**: Every element is thoughtfully styled with **smooth transitions** and **modern animations**, providing a visually appealing and interactive experience. Loading states are animated to keep users engaged while data is fetched.

- **Advanced React Hooks**: The app showcases the use of powerful React hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useContext` to manage state, side effects, and global states. These hooks ensure smooth updates to the UI, making the app feel highly responsive.

#### **Technologies Used**:
- **React** for component-driven development
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive design
- **React Router DOM** for seamless navigation
- **Axios** for handling asynchronous API requests
- **Unsplash API** for fetching images
- **LocalStorage** for persistent data management
- **React Hooks** for managing UI states and effects

This project showcases the **capabilities of React** in creating a well-structured, highly interactive gallery app with a smooth and efficient UI. It's designed to highlight skills in both **front-end development** and **modern user experience design**. You can check out the project and the code in my GitHub repository!
